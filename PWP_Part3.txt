Flexbox
An Intro to Flexbox, what is Flex(box)?
Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout module designed to make it easier to align and distribute space among items in a container. It allows for more dynamic, responsive layouts, where elements can automatically adjust their size and position based on the available space.
Key features of Flexbox include:
* Horizontal and Vertical Alignment: Flexbox makes it easy to center items both horizontally and vertically.
* Responsive Layouts: Items can grow, shrink, or wrap to fit different screen sizes.
* Efficient Spacing: Properties like justify-content and align-items help control space between and around items.
* Flexible Item Sizing: The flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties let items adjust size based on their container.
Flexbox is especially useful for creating complex layouts without relying on float or positioning, making it an ideal choice for modern, responsive web design.

Flexbox Instructions
We will be reconfiguring our 3-column layout to use Flexbox styling.
1. Comment out your current rulesets for your classes assigned to the row and column in your style(s).css file. Use CTRL+/ to comment out blocks of code. Highlight the entire ruleset with your mouse or keyboard, then hit CTRL+/

2. Assign a class of container to your <tag>s that contain class="row" to ALSO include a new class called “container”. 
3. Assign each <tag> belonging to class="column" a new additional class="box".
4. In your .css file, add two new rulesets to apply to .container and .box
a. .container needs a background-color & padding
b. .box needs a background-color, color, padding, and margin. 
c. Experiment with colors, padding, and margin possibilities to find your aesthetic.
5. To enable flexbox, add display: flex to .container.
6. Add the justify-content property to .container and experiment with different values.
a. justify-content: flex-start; (default)
b. justify-content: center;
c. justify-content: space-between;
d. justify-content: space-around;
7. Observe how the different values affect the spacing between items in the container. 
8. Add height: 300px to .container to create more space within it. 
9. Use the align-items property to align items vertically:
a. align-items: flex-start;
b. align-items: center;
c. align-items: flex-end;
10. Add flex-grow to one of the .box elements to make it expand
a. Ex. flex-grow: 1; on your 2nd box <tag> to make Box 2 grow. 
b. Try using style: flex-grow inside your html <tag>.
11. Try adding flex-grow to all .box elements and set different values 
a. Ex. flex-grow: 2; on Box 1.
12. Using what you've learned, align the boxes in the center of the container with even spacing.
13. Add a fourth box (of your topic of choice) and experiment with different flex-grow values to adjust their sizes.
14. Bonus Point: Apply flex-direction: column; to see how Flexbox can create vertical layouts as well.
a.  Do this in a page that is not your home index.html page. 


Forms
In your Contact Me page, add a form. HTML Forms
The form should include the following fields:
* Name (text input)
* Email (email input)
* Message (textarea for a longer message)
* Submit Button to send the form.
* Add a phone number field with a pattern to validate the format (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXXX). HTML input type="tel"
* HTML button tag W3Schools documentation
* Add a radio button selection to select either Question or Comment or Suggestion. HTML Form Elements
* Make sure only one radio button can be selected at once by assigning all three the same name.
Example starter Code:
<form> 
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Form Validation
* Make the Name and Email fields required. HTML Input Attributes
* Ensure that the Email field is validated to check for a proper email format.
* Set a minlength of 10 characters for the Message field to encourage detailed input.
Styling:
* Style the form to match the rest of the webpage.
* Add hover styles for ALL buttons, links, and images across your website.
Example code for the hover styling on your buttons, links, and images. 

* Add focus styles for inputs and buttons.
Example code for the focus styling on your input fields for the form. 

* Use padding, borders, and colors to make the form visually appealing and consistent with the page.
* Use CSS grid or flexbox to align the form fields in a structured, user-friendly way.
Final Expectations
* Use Flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow.
* Arrange elements horizontally and vertically within a container.
* Apply Flexbox knowledge to create flexible, responsive layouts.
* Style error messages for invalid fields.
* If you do not have the NavBar set up on each of your pages, do that.
o Your active page must be highlighted to indicate which page you’re on.
* Make sure each page is linked to your stylesheet and that there is a consistent styling across every page on your website.
* The 3-4 columns need to be alternating in coloring. Eg. Black-white-black-white. 
o You may need to create an in-line styling for the CSS rule for this in the .html file. 
* Do some research and find out how to make your site mobile compatible. This is a requirement.
